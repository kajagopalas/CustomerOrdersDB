## Project Overview

CustomerOrdersDB is a practical, self-developed SQL project that simulates complex customer order management and analytics for real-world business scenarios.

Designed to continuously strengthen SQL proficiency and demonstrate hands-on solutions for business intelligence and data analytics.

-----

## Features

**Realistic Business Scenario**: Represents actual customer order workflows with tables for customers, orders, products, and related details.

**Advanced SQL Queries**: Demonstrates joins, aggregations, CTEs, window functions, and subqueries to perform insightful data analysis.

**Normalized Schema Design**: Follows industry best practices for relational integrity and efficient data storage.

**Date Hierarchy Dimension**: Implements a structured date hierarchy (Year \> Quarter \> Month \> Day) to enable flexible time-based analysis and reporting.

**Product Hierarchy Dimension**: Implements a structured product hierarchy (Category \> Subcategory \> Product) to enable flexible product-level, category-level, and portfolio-level analysis and reporting.

**Sample Data & Use Cases**: Includes synthetic but realistic sample data and example queries aligned with common business questions.

**Active Development & Improvement**: Continuously updated with new queries, optimizations, and documentation based on feedback and learning.

## Dashboards & Visualizations

The `CustomerOrdersDB` project can power comprehensive business intelligence dashboards, providing insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and product trends. The following are examples of dashboards and visualizations that can be created using the data and queries from this project.

### Core Business Performance KPIs

This dashboard provides a holistic view of key sales metrics, including total revenue, average order value per customer, and average items per order. It showcases the project's ability to support high-level business overviews and key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Business Performance Overview

This dashboard presents a detailed breakdown of revenue by product and salesperson, alongside daily trend analysis. It demonstrates the use of advanced SQL queries for multi-dimensional analysis, enabling users to identify top-performing products and sales team members.

### Measuring and Analyzing Order Performance

This dashboard focuses on product-specific performance and sales trends over time. It includes tables for product performance and sales trends, as well as a visual representation of revenue versus quantity over time, highlighting the project's capacity for time-series analysis and detailed reporting.
